# About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting coding integrated into my life in the same level as video games are, hopefully forming a career or at least a base for one in the process.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python but not avoiding other languages as well.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything with a person who has patience.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting out of tutorial hell.
- 💬 Ask me about how much I like robots.
- 📫 How to reach me: Online or by bottles thrown into your closest ocean.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him or They/Them, either works.
- 🐟 Fun fact: If a video game lets me name my player character, I name them after a species of fish. (My Elden Ring character is named Marlin) 🐟

Extra backstory:
I took an official University course on the basics of programming in Python. The form of it was independent studying with online programming homework and weekly online lectures. I failed my first attempt at the final test, but I am allowed to try again and I will. I believe I have a decent base in programming, my problem solving skills are fairly good and I need to get out of tutorial hell. And there is still a lot to learn, which I am still doing with great interest.
